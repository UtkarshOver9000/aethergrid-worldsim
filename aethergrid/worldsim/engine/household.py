"""One household as a simulation entity. Owns its static config (identity,
position, archetype, appliance ownership) and simulates its own full
time series: occupancy-triggered untouchable/deferrable/thermostatic/
storage appliance state, real indoor-temperature RC dynamics, EV/battery/
DHW physical state via the REUSED pure functions from
aethergrid.simulation.{thermal,storage,electrical}.

Charging/heating/battery behavior here is deliberately UNCONTROLLED
("dumb") -- max-rate charging when present, thermostat bang-bang for AC,
greedy self-consumption for the battery. This is a world simulation, not
a controller: the point is to produce a believable baseline the (not-
built-here) optimizer could later act on, not to already be optimal.
